## Salesforce Spring Rules for Bazel (Kotlin Example)

This repository contains the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) rule
  for the [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) build system.
It enables Bazel to build Spring Boot applications and package them as an executable jar file.
The executable jar is the best way to deploy your Spring Boot application in production environments.

This particular branch only contains the Kotlin example.
It is kept separate in its own branch so as not to require Kotlin in the main branches.
